Zend Framework 2 - Initial Experiment
=====================================

Just a simple project to play with ZF2, see how it does things, and figure out how best to get a Data Mapper pattern running for the "M" in MVC,
factoring in things such as readibility, ease of use, and minimal boilerplate code

A to-do list exists below, and a description of the core files/processes will be here soon too

Currently sports custom PDO database accessor, Mapper-Model pattern for data access itself, lazy loading placeholders for referenced/dependent objects,
and *much* tidier (although more boilerplate-y) layout of Model and Mappers over my ZF1 experiment

To Do
=====

See "todo.txt"
